          Hello everyone! In this blog we are going to discuss on the topic of
          HTML and CSS in the fun way. As you all know that, HTML and CSS are
          used for making beautiful websites templates. The HyperText Markup
          Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
          designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript. HTML. (HyperText Markup Language).

          HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
          constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
          embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
          structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.

          <br />

          HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
          Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such
          as surround and provide information about document text and may
          include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
          tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML can embed
          programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which
          affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS
          defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
          standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
          HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display
          video and audio, primarily using the element, in collaboration with
          javascript.
