            Hello everyone! In this blog we are going to discuss on the topic of how to design beautiful sites. As you all know that, HTML and CSS are used for making beautiful websites templates.
            Did you know that 48 percent of people say that a website’s design is the number one determining factor for the credibility of a business? Your audience’s first impression comes from your website’s design. Beautiful websites are crucial for making an impactful and positive first impression for your audience.
            <br>
            <br>
            On this page, we’ll provide you with six tips for creating beautiful websites. Keep reading to learn more about how to create a visually appealing and functional website for your audience.

            When you’re designing your site, it’s easy to get caught up in adding too many elements to your pages. You want your site to be visually appealing, so you continually add elements to add another dimension of visual interest to your page. This can lead to your site getting cluttered or overwhelming.
            <br>
            <br>
            The other issue is that, if certain elements don’t have a purpose on your site, it can leave your audience confused. Every element on your site should have a purpose. Imagine putting a call-to-action (CTA) button that doesn’t lead to a new page.
            <br>
            <br>
            People would constantly try to click on the button, and it would leave them confused as to why it doesn’t take them somewhere. Or, think what would happen if an HVAC website design prompted users to “Call now” on a top-of-the-funnel blog post. People probably wouldn’t click.
            <br>
            <br>
            That CTA would also come off as pushy and impact a reader’s impression of the company. Every element on your page needs a purpose. Don’t put something on your site solely because it adds to the aesthetic of your page.
            <br>
            <br>
            Create elements that are functional and enhance the user experience on your site.
