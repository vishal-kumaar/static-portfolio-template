        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <b>Hey There Everyone I'm Steve Rogers<br /> </b>
          a college student and also a web designer. I make
          beautiful websites by the core of my heart by using my very little
          knowledge in HTML and CSS by using more coffee over codes :)
          <br /><br />
          I study The word “Discipline” is explained in the dictionary as – “the
          practice of training people to obey rules or a code of behaviour,
          using punishment to correct disobedience.” It is evident from the
          explanation that the main objective of discipline is to train people
          so that they obey definite rules and regulations promptly. To make
          sure that the rules are obeyed and the discipline maintained, there is
          also a provision for punishment or penalty. <br /><br />
          Discipline is imposed by a person upon himself or herself or onto
          others, often for good reasons and to get desirable results. Like, if
          you have disciplined yourself in studies and decided that you will
          self-study for 4-5 hours at home every day, under any circumstances;
          the decision is likely to improve your grades and make your career
          stable. <br /><br />
          In another example, if a prompt policeman fines a person for driving
          recklessly or without wearing a helmet; it is only to ensure the
          safety of the person and in consideration of the general good of the
          society. However, some caution must be exercised while setting rules
          and regulations and any inconvenience caused to the followers of the
          rules must also be considered. For example, if the policeman in the
          above example not only fines the person but also puts him in prison
          for a minor offense, then it would be a case of discipline gone beyond
          the limit. <br /><br />
          Similarly, if your school management dismisses you for a week for not
          completing an assignment; such harsh punishment for an act of minor
          negligence can’t be justified as disciplinary action.
